Kang Liang is currently an undergraduate student in USTC. He is going to be a PhD student in [Southern Methodist University][smu] advised by [Prof. Zhong Lu][zhonglu] in fall 2020.

He has a passion for developing InSAR technique, applying it to further understanding and characterizing geodynamic phenomena(e.g. Volcano and landslide). He is alse interested in machine learning and try to combine it with his work.

He always have curiosity about fancy but useful knowledge, tools and techniques. And he is a hardcore fan of Rock & Roll. His favorite musician is [Cui Jian][cuijian].
